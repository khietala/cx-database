# cx-database

A Kotlin Spark application for managing a classic car database.

Originally targeted for Citroen Car Club Queensland.

## Design

A standard MVC app implemented with Apache Spark and using Kotlin programming language.

Uses Apache Velocity templating engine.

### Database

In the first instance the vehicle data is stored in a json file but I will work on using a database, oribably nosql as there is no need for relational data here.
